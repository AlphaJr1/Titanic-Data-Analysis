## Introduction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to analyze the data of Titanic passengers to understand the factors that influenced survival rates.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlphaJr1/titanic-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    cd titanic-data-analysis
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files:
- `2_3_2AM_Titanic.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the dependencies.
- `data/`: A directory to store the dataset.
- `images/`: A directory to store images and visualizations.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and tools.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook 2_3_2AM_Titanic.ipynb
```

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the survival rates of Titanic passengers based on various factors such as age, gender, class, and more. Visualizations and statistical models are used to illustrate these findings.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis and machine learning techniques can be applied to historical datasets to uncover valuable insights. The Titanic dataset serves as a great example for learning and practicing these skills.
